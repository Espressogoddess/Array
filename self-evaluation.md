## Self Evaluation
*How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?*
- I feel like I am beginning to get a grasp on the concepts. I still need to reference my notes for this.
*Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?*
- I'd like to reference back to MDN to the different array methods.
- I need to get remember the proper syntax when using parantheses or brackets, etc.
*What questions do you have about arrays?*
- I am curious as to how many variables can be included in a single array?
